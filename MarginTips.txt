MarginTips

Front End Ideas

Alreayd had a simple design in mind 

ideally a simple to scroll list of games played this week

lighter green for team which you believe will win the margin

lighter red for the team which will lose

darker Green/Red for games which you can't tip on anymore (game has started)

Experiment with how layout works particularly with mobile


Results page for games after they have been completed
- ideally colors depending how good you do
- colours if you guess exact margin
- colours for 1 point difference
- colours for between 1-6 points difference


Backend Set up 

- Need users 
- Users should be able to create Competitions
- Competitions should have admins (multiple)
- admins should have extra powers
- attempt to follow a restful style api

For now will store the passwords as best as possible 

Testing a mock game model getting information from a game service

Headaches happened when adding a database support for the models 

	Not really sure what happened

	Reverting back to base and making sure each component works independently

	removed files which were only needed locally (generated to make the it work)

Initial ideas SMALL STEPS:
	
	Get it working get an endpoint about matches which takes a Static data from a "Service"

	Match Model:
	 - Start time
	 - Game Complete ?
	 - Home Team 
	 - Away Team
	 - Home Score
	 - Away Score

	 Considering Testing?

Initially mocked up the users way of experience it:
Mocked up a quick wireframe for front end to understand what data I will need to store and create on the backend

Just drew some quick pictures to see what it would look like as a web app

Determined what tables would be needed to be stored in the database:
	tables:
	- Player
	- League (Data about League settings )
	- Members (Intersection between League and Player Data and data about roles and Player Aliases)
	- Game
	- Tips (Intersection between Player League and Games)


Using the api @ api.Squiggle.com.au to get game information

1st implementation Retrieveing Game Data:
	- How to Get data 
	- Scheduled Per End of Game to do a HTTPRequest to get data
	- Store data

	Edge Cases:
	- Daylight Savings
		- The Schedule seems to Account for this on the API side
	- Games Getting Rescheduled
	- AFL score changes post game

	Get a data with C# http client and it into a usable C# object

	Testing This Particular Component of the Code Particularly the model of the Game

	Created a method which calls the games successfully (fixed http get)

	no choice of particular game

Followed 1st implementation of Game Data for Team Data

Scaffolded the rest of according to the database design:

	Created Models based on tables:
		Also Created a Helper Model SquiggleResponse:
			*** might be able to Delete it later
	Created Services which use the use the models and are consumed by the controllers:
		Usually a Service Per Controlller
	Created Controllers for Each service [Each Controller is Resource based]:
		Might want to create More Generalized one to have both AFL and NBA data in it

Considering how to deploy the application:
	Where should the application be?
	DO I NEED A DATABASE?
		Where should the database be?
		HOW should it be attached to the database?

Realistically this could all be done writing and reading from an google sheet?
	Possible Solution and possible way to use.

Learning Cors Enabling and Getting FrontEnd to Post:
	Backend Side is straight forward with the middleware module and examples in the documentation.
